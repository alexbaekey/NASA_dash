The results are intended to be read as follows:

"By the year 2183, The projected mean Sea-Level will reach the Annapolis NOAA station's coastal height." The term "sunk" is intentionally overly simplified.

This answers Julie's homeowner question. But as you can see, there are many qualifiers, some of which can be worked out with better software design, data handling, web-app--programming, etc; others are stepped-around for the sake of complete public-facing accuracy. (For instance, you wouldn't want to say "sunk", as it's not really true, but much easier to understand than "anomaly-free projection of SML from historical data meets coastal height".)
